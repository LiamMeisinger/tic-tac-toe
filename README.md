**Liam Meisinger's Tic Tac Toe Game**

Welcome to a classic game of Tic Tac Toe implemented in Python! This project is a command-line game allowing two 
players to enjoy Tic Tac Toe with a text-based interface. Future updates will include an AI opponent for 
single-player gameplay.

Overview
This project is a simple, object-oriented Python program for playing Tic Tac Toe. The game is played in the command 
line, with players taking turns choosing their moves. The game automatically checks for a winner or a draw after 
each move and displays the results.

**Game Rules**
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players, X and O, take turns marking empty cells on the grid.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all nine cells are filled without a winner, the game is a draw.

**Features**

- Two-player Mode: The game alternates turns between Player X and Player O.
- Win and Draw Detection: The game checks for a win or draw after each move.
- Play Again Option: After each game, players have the option to play again.

**How to Play**
- After starting the game, players take turns entering their move. Enter a number between 1 and 9 to select the corresponding position on the board:
- The game will display the board after each move and indicate if a player has won or if the game is a draw.
- Once the game ends, players can choose to play again or exit.

Future Enhancements
- Single-Player Mode: Add an AI opponent for single-player gameplay.
- Graphical Interface: Implement a GUI to make the game more visually appealing.
